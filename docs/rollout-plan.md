# Rollout Plan

## Pilot (1-2 teams)
- Enable local routing for L0/L1 tasks only.
- Run probes daily and monitor logs.
- Collect feedback on quality and latency.

## Team (wider adoption)
- Expand to L2 tasks with explicit approval.
- Enforce policy engine checks.
- Track cost savings and quality metrics.

## Org-Wide
- Standardize router config and policy rules.
- Integrate plugin commands into onboarding.
- Prepare upstream proposal with benchmarks and risk review.
